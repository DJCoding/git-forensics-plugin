The Default value is 100 commits, so if the branch has more than 100 commits since the last contact with the master branch
the reference finder will stop. If for some reason the finder will not be able to find an intersection between the current branch
and the master branch (for unknown reason) this check will ensure that the finder will not take forever to search for it. But
this scenario should not occur and usually developing branches should not be that far from the master branch.
